Hi, I'm Connor! I'm from Carlsbad, CA and am a data scientist currently living in New York City.

I started my journey into data science from the world of television news production after I had the realization that audience viewing habits impact TV coverage in a huge way. Ever since I started working on the research and data science side of the industry (rather than production), I have developed a greater appreciation for and fascination in the media landscape as a whole.  

Some of my most interesting projects to date include: 

- forecasting the audience of a cable network's programming, weeks to years ahead of time, to help set the overall network budget
- using AI to process cable news closed captions to measure the impact of content on viewership
- building custom APIs with endpoints to fetch data on demand, make predictions based on input data, share content via email and other platforms, etc. 

When not performing data dives, you can often find me playing and coaching water polo, reenacting the American Civil War, or at the beach.  

If you would like to learn more about me, or what I do, please check out some of the links on the left - and don't hesitate to reach out!
